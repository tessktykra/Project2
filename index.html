                    <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The Ramakien is the Thai adaptation of the Indian Ramayana epic. It tells the story of Prince Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, as he battles the demon king Tosakan (Ravana in the Ramayana) to rescue his beloved wife, Sida (Sita).
                The tale is deeply woven into Thai culture, art, dance (Khon), and literature, with many temples and murals depicting scenes from the epic.
                <br><br>
                Pictured above on the left is a character called Tosakan (ทศกัณฐ์) – The Demon King. He has ten faces and twenty arms, symbolising his immense power and supernatural abilities.
                Though he is the antagonist, he is not portrayed as purely evil; rather, he is a ruler with wisdom and devotion to his own kingdom. However, his downfall stems from his arrogance and desire for Sida, whom he kidnaps and holds captive.
                <br> In Thai traditional arts, Tosakan is often represented in Khon masked dance-drama, where performers wear elaborately decorated green-faced masks with golden crowns.
                He is also a popular figure in Thai temple murals and sculptures, reflecting his deep-rooted presence in Buddhist and royal artistic traditions.
            <br><br>
            Sida (สีดา), the heroine of the Ramakien, is used to embody virtue, loyalty, and inner strength, and as the wife of Rama, she is a symbol of the ideal Thai woman- graceful and morally steadfast.
            In Thai culture, Sida is revered as a model of female virtue and endurance, and her character is frequently depicted in classical Khon (Thai dance) performances, murals, and Thai literary adaptations.
            She represents not just a mythical heroine but an embodiment of traditional Thai values, reinforcing the themes of honor, sacrifice, and devotion.
